A single solution containing sample implementations of different Design Patterns (Singleton - Observer - Strategy), all separated within their own respective folders.
When running this code, make sure to comment the implementation of the Sinlgeton OUT if trying to run the Observer or Strategy Pattern. 
The thread locking implemented will also force the execution of the other Patterns to be stuck in the queue behind the locked threads. (alternatively, change the execution order)
